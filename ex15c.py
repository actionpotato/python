# This is just the output from example 6, on page 80

# Note, I had already run "python" when I typed the following:

>>> file_stuff = open("ex15_sample.txt","r")
>>> print file_stuff.read()
This is stuff I typed into a file.
It is really cool stuff.
Lots and lots of fun to have in here.


# I used "file_stuff" as my variable, and I used "open"
# However, I had to specify the file first, and then what I wanted to do with it.
# Thats why it reads: "ex15_sample.txt","r" between the brackets of Open
#
# Once I did that, I was able to print the object I had called before
